# Python Learning Repository
This repository contains various projects and exercises created during my journey of learning Python. It includes scripts, examples, and notes on Python fundamentals, data structures, algorithms, and other programming concepts. A dedicated folder is included for my first Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) scripts.

## Repository Structure
- **General Scripts.** A variety of Python scripts that focus on the basics, including:
    - Data types and variables
    - Control flow (if statements, loops)
    - Functions and modules
    - Basic data structures like lists, dictionaries, and sets
- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Exercises.** A dedicated folder (`OOP_exercises/`) that contains my first OOP projects, applying core principles to bioinformatics problems, specifically for DNA and RNA sequence analysis. Examples of OOP concepts demonstrated include:
    - **Class Definitions:** Encapsulating data and behavior within classes for modular and reusable code.
    - **Inheritance:** Extending base classes to build specialized bioinformatics functionalities.
    - **Encapsulation:** Managing access to class attributes through private and protected members.
    - **Polymorphism:** Creating methods adaptable to different objects, supporting various types of analyses.
## Purpose
This repository serves as a reference and learning resource for Python programming and bioinformatics applications. It will continue to grow as I advance in Python, adding new projects, topics, and refined scripts.
